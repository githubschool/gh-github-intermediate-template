# Lab 4: Interactive Rebase

In this lab, you're going to use `git rebase --interactive` to take an outdated
feature branch and move it to the latest commit on `main`.

## Scenario

The product team has told us that a work-in-progress feature needs to be
reprioritized. This feature was partially completed, and then put on hold. The
branch is still present, so letâ€™s bring it back up to date and deliver that
feature.

## Task 1: Checkout the Feature Branch

1. Checkout the feature branch

   ```bash
   git checkout feature/lab-4
   ```

1. Verify the feature branch is behind `main`

   ```bash
   git log --oneline --graph --all
   ```

   In the graph output, you should see that the `feature/lab-4` branch was
   created from an earlier commit on `main`.

   ```plain
   * a4f1x35 Update scoreboard size
   * f723e2f Remove comment
   * d2b828f Revert change
   | * 0f3cb0b (HEAD -> feature/lab-4) Animate score update
   |/
   * 35710de (origin/main) Add watch script
   * 6181c9c Update ESLint config
   ```

## Task 2: Rebase the Feature Branch

1. Interactively rebase the feature branch onto `main`

   ```bash
   git rebase --interactive main
   ```

   In the editor that opens, you should see a list of commits. The first commit
   is the one that the branch was created from, and the last commit is the most
   recent commit on `main`.

   ```plain
   pick 0f3cb0b Animate score update
   pick a4f1x35 Update scoreboard size
   pick f723e2f Remove comment
   pick d2b828f Revert change
   ```

   In this exercise, we want to combine all the commits on the `feature/lab-4`
   branch into a single commit. This will make it easier to follow the changes
   in the commit history.

1. Update the commit list to squash all the commits into a single commit and
   modify the commit message.

   ```plain
   reword 0f3cb0b Animate score update
   squash a4f1x35 Update scoreboard size
   squash f723e2f Remove comment
   squash d2b828f Revert change
   ```

   Save and close the editor.

   > **Hint:** If you are using VI or VIM, you can save and close the editor by
   > pressing `ESC`, typing `:wq`, and pressing `Enter`.
