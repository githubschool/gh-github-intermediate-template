# Lab 8: Merge Conflicts

In this lab, you're going to resolve merge conflicts in the GitHub UI as well as
the command line.

## Scenario

Several teammates have made adjustments to the game to change the difficulty.
It's up to you to review their pull requests, resolve any conflicts, and merge
their changes!

## Task 1: Review and Merge the First Pull Request (GitHub UI)

When you review and merge the first pull request, you'll see that there is
already a merge conflict. In this task, you will resolve this conflict in the
GitHub UI.

## Task 2: Review and Merge the Second Pull Request (Command Line)

When you review and merge the first pull request, you'll see that there is
already a merge conflict. In this task, you will resolve this conflict using the
command line.

## Need Help?

If you're having trouble with any of the steps, you can ask for help in the
meeting chat.
